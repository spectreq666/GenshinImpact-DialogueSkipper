Automated dialogue skipping utility for Genshin Impact using computer vision and image recognition.



## 📋 Description

This application automatically detects active dialogues in Genshin Impact and presses the F key to skip them. It uses OpenCV for template matching, making it more reliable than pixel-based methods.

## ✨ Features

- 🖼️ **Computer Vision** - Dialogue detection using template matching
- ⌨️ **Hotkey Controls** - Simple management with F8, F9, F12 keys
- ⏱️ **Randomized Intervals** - Natural behavior to avoid detection
- ☕ **Smart Breaks** - Random pauses for human-like behavior
- 🔧 **Auto Resolution Detection** - Automatically detects and configures screen resolution
- 💾 **Configuration Persistence** - Saves settings to `.env` file

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Launch Genshin Impact** and enter the game world
2. **Run the application** as Administrator (important for screen capture and key emulation)
